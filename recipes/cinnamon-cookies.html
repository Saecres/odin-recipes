    <h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugars. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cinnamon sugar coating. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon for the coating.</li>
        <li>Shape the cookies. Scoop out tablespoon-sized balls of dough, roll them in the cinnamon sugar coating, and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake to perfection. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are just set but the centers are still soft. Let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
